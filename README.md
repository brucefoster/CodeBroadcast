It's simple and works with WebRTC which makes it fast and don't requires lots of PC resources, so you can broadcast your code even from your tablet.

Also you can execute your code directly from broadcaster's interface without leaving it and share execution result between connected viewers. Execution with custom GET parameters supported too.

Your code will be shown on each connected users device simultaneously.
