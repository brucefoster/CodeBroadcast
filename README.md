###What is CodeBroadcast?

CodeBroadcast is a tool to broadcast PHP, HTML and JS code in **real-time** using WebRTC.

It's made lightweight and works using **WebRTC** technology that provide instant P2P data transfer. Being supported by Google Chrome and Firefox you can broadcast your code, for example, to Android devices (it can be useful in purposes of education) and, of course, to PCs/Notebooks.

You can also **execute your code directly from broadcaster's interface**: the result will be instantly sent to all the connected viewers. Execution with **custom GET parameters** is supported too.

Written code will be broadcasted to all the connected devices simultaneously (read more about basics of P2P and WebRTC).
