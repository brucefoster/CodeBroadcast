####What is CodeBroadcast?

CodeBroadcast is a tool to broadcast PHP code in **real-time**:

It's simple and works with **WebRTC** which makes it fast and don't requires lots of PC resources, so you can broadcast your code even **from your tablet**.

Also you can **execute your code directly from broadcaster's interface** without leaving it and share execution result between connected viewers. Execution with **custom GET parameters** supported too.

Your code will be shown on each connected users device simultaneously.
